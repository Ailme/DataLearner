# DataLearner - Machine-Learning on Android
DataLearner is an easy-to-use tool for machine-learning and knowledge discovery from your own compatible training datasets. It’s fully self-contained, requires no external storage or network connectivity – it builds machine-learning models directly on your phone or tablet. 

DataLearner features classification, association and clustering algorithms from the open-source Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) package, plus new algorithms developed by the Data Science Research Unit (DSRU) at Charles Sturt University. Combined, the app provides over 30 machine-learning/data-mining algorithms, including RandomForest, C4.5 (J48) and NaiveBayes.

DataLearner collects no information – it requires access to your device storage simply to load your datasets and build your requested models.

DataLearner is open-source, with the source code for this project available at github.com/darrenyatesau/DataLearner.
