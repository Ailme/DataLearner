# DataLearner - Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery on Android

DataLearner is an open-source easy-to-use tool for data mining and knowledge discovery from your own compatible training datasets. It’s fully self-contained, requires no external storage or network connectivity – it builds machine-learning models directly on your phone or tablet.

DataLearner features classification, association and clustering algorithms from the open-source Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) package, plus new algorithms developed by the Data Science Research Unit (DSRU) at Charles Sturt University. Combined, the app currently provides 40 machine-learning/data-mining algorithms, including RandomForest, C4.5 (J48) and NaiveBayes.

DataLearner collects no information – it requires access to your device storage simply to load your datasets and build your requested models.
